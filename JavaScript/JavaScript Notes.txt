
1. When calculating money:

Calculate in cents
Convert back to dollars

       #cents       #dollars

'$' + (2095 + 799) / 100

output: '$28.94'




2. Always use (') single quote as default:

'hello'

"I'm John"




3. Always use 2 spaces per indent in HTML, CSS & JS




4. Do not use eval() function.

However, it's important to note that using eval() can be dangerous if the string being evaluated is not trusted or comes from an untrusted source. 
This is because eval() can execute any JavaScript code, including malicious code, and potentially compromise the security of your application. 
It's generally recommended to avoid using eval() whenever possible, and to use safer alternatives like JSON.parse() or regular expressions to parse and evaluate strings.




5. Interpolation is recommended much cleaner
`Items (${1+1}): $${(2095 + 799) / 100}`




6. Use single quotes as default
'hello'
`Items (${1+1}): $${(2095 + 799) / 100}`



7. camelCase is the standard for JavaScript
let cartQuantity = 0;



8. Comparison Operators:
always use === and !--
do not use == and !=



9. variables scope only exist inside the {...}



10. Falsy Values:
false	0	''	NaN	undefined	null
any value not on this list is truthly

if (cartQuality) {
        console.log('cart has products');
      }



11. if else statement alternative or shortcut:
true ? 'truthy' : 'falsly'

if (true) {
  'truthy'
} else {
  'falsy'
}

Math.random() - generates random math.
